Password Generator

The Password Generator will work once the user hits the "Generate Password" button.

Once the button is clicked, the user will be asked the desired length of the password which must be supplies as a number.

If the user does not select within the parameters of 8-128 character, the program will stop and user must start over.

The user will then be asked a series of questions regarding the types of characters desired through a series of confirm statements
i.e. special character, uppercase, lowercase and/or numbers.

The program will validate that the user selected at least one character type and then the password will generate on the screen in the display box and will meet the user's criteria.

An invalid response will terminate the password generation and the user must start over.
